Easily add custom CSS, JavaScript, HTML and PHP code to unique CJT code blocks and assign them wherever you want.

== Description ==

= IMPORTANT NOTE: =
The CSS & JavaScript Toolbox plugin on WordPress.org is no longer supported. This has been replaced by our new code management plugin called Easy Code Manager, which you can download for free here: [Easy Code Manager on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-code-manager)

This free version has been fully redesigned and does not have a number of features you would expect in CSS & JavaScript Toolbox. That said, you may wish to stay on CSS & JavaScript Toolbox unless you intend to update to our premium Easy Code Manager PLUS plugin.

= Easy Code Manager PLUS =
This is our premium plugin that extends the free version of Easy Code Manager - adding an amazing amount of features. Why not take a look to see if it suits your needs.  Click here: [Easy Code Manager PLUS](https://easy-code-manager.com)

= Compatibility =
At this stage CSS & JavaScript Toolbox and Easy Code Manager cannot be installed and activated at the same time. It is advised to BACKUP all your CSS & JavaScript Toolbox code blocks, code files and template data, and take note of all your assignments and shortcode placements. This is a precautionary recommendation so you donâ€™t lose your work.

Once CSS & JavaScript Toolbox is deactivated, then you should be able to install and activate Easy Code Manager. Currently, both plugins share the same database structure and depending on your current version of CSS & JavaScript Toolbox, you may just see all your original CJT code blocks intact in the Easy Code Manager main dashboard. However, please do not rely on this and BACKUP all of your work before trying to install the Easy Code Manager plugins on your site.

= CSS & JavaScript Toolbox premium license holders =
If you are a premium CSS & JavaScript Toolbox (CJT) license holder with a valid license key that has NOT expired, you will be eligible to receive Easy Code Manager for free with one year of premium updates. Please send us a message along with your valid license key via our Contact page OR via: info (at) easy-code-manager.com

Thanks for your support.
